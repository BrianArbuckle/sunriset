A Solar Calculator
==========

This packege generates **Solar Posistion Data** based on Latitiude, Logitude, Date and Time Zone.  Future updates will include elevation data.  

The initial goal was to create a *simple* function that produced the daily sunrise and sunset for any given location. These calculations create a large amount of usefull data that can be used for other solar related calculations and are based on the caculations from [NOAA (National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration)](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/solcalc/).  The calaculations can be used in various projects, including but not limited to, Solar Panel Placement, Sun Exposure for Building Construction, Photography and Circadian Rhythm based IOT projects and Timers.
