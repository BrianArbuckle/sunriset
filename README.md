A Solar Calculator

This packege can generate **Solar Posistion Data** based on Latitiude, Logitude, Date and Time Zone.  Future updates will include elevation data.  

The initial goal was to create a "simple" function that produced the daily sunrise and sunset for any given location. This calculation, or I shoudl say calculations, created a large amount of usefull data that can be used for other solar related calculations, including but not limited to, Solar Panel Placement, Build Construction, Photography and Circadian Rhythm based IOT projects and Timer.
